      Hello, I am Kim MacVicar and I am a student front-end developer. I decided
      on a new career path about 6 months ago and decided to take some courses
      with SheCodes! It has been great and challenging at times. I have really
      been enjoying the weekly challenges and learning the new skills that have
      come along with them. I look forward to a career as a front-end developing
      in the future! I know there will be a lot of learning ahead of me and am
      excited for it all.
    </p><p class="welcome2">
      I am also a big animal lover, I have two dogs that have been with me for a very long time.  They are my best friends and are very loved and extremely spoiled.  They deserve the best, just like all animals!
<p class="welcome2">
I also love crafting. Pretty much any craft. Specifically I love beading, crocheting, glass fusing, pottery, paiting and embroidery. But I am up for pretty much any craft. The possibilities are endless!</p>
