      Hello, I am Kim MacVicar and I am a student front-end developer. I decided
      on a new career path about 6 months ago and decided to take some courses
      with SheCodes! It has been great and challenging at times. I have really
      been enjoying the weekly challenges and learning the new skills that have
      come along with them. I look forward to a career as a front-end developing
      in the future! I know there will be a lot of learning ahead of me and am
      excited for it all.

  <p class="text-muted mb-4">This is a fun set of nesting tables that I refinished in my spare time.  I sanded and cleaned them up, painted them each is a lovely colour, then added gold leaf to the bottom of each leg. Then finished then with clear coat. They were a lot of fun to work on, but took quite a while to complete. I really enjoy any type of crafty projects.</p>
