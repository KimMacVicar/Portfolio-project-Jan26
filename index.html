  <p class="text-muted mb-4">This is a fun set of nesting tables that I refinished in my spare time.  I sanded and cleaned them up, painted them each is a lovely colour, then added gold leaf to the bottom of each leg. Then finished then with clear coat. They were a lot of fun to work on, but took quite a while to complete. I really enjoy any type of crafty projects.</p>
